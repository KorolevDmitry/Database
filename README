Dmitry Korolev, Computer Science Center, 2013

Database designed to use simple key-value (string-string) storage.
You can launch program under 3 different modes (depends on arguments):
1. Memory - to store values only in memory.
2. File {path_to_store_files_with_last_dash} {fileSplitSize} - to store values only in file storage.
3. Combined {path_to_store_files_with_last_dash} {fileSplitSize} {memoryMaxSize} - to store values only in combined storage mode.
path_to_store_files_with_last_dash - directory where to store files of database.
fileSplitSize - how many files will database be kept in.
memoryMaxSize - size of elements that will be kept in memory.

There are number of commands: GET, ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, HELP, QUIT.

You can generate initial data to database by providing 2 additional arguments:
valueSize - size of value in bytes
elementsCount - count of generated elements
